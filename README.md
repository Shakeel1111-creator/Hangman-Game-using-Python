# Hangman-Game-using-Python

Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. This project implements the Hangman game in Python.

**Features**
Single-player mode: The player competes against the computer.
Random word selection: Words are randomly chosen from a predefined list.
Feedback on guesses: Displays the correctly guessed letters and remaining attempts.
Game status: Indicates when the player has won or lost.
Replay option: Allows players to play multiple rounds.

**How to Play**
The computer selects a random word, and its length is displayed as underscores (_).
The player guesses one letter at a time.
For each correct guess, the letter is revealed in its correct position(s).
For each incorrect guess, the remaining attempts decrease.
The game ends when:
The player correctly guesses the word (win).
The player runs out of attempts (lose).
After the game ends, the player can choose to play again
